This is almost a 3 year ol project. Unfortnately, I lost my interest to the game and delayed article.

Codes were written in MATLAB but equations can be translated in other languages. I encourage you to use them to make contributions to game. I apreciate referances ;)

Since It's an old project I don't remember most of its parts but Theoretical_Hitter should be most useful one.
